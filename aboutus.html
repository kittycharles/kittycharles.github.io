  <h2>About The Gallery</h2>
   <p> Gallery Hours:Tuesday - Saturday 11am - 6pm </p>
  <p>The Angelo Art Gallerys collection of paintings spans more than 60 years and styles range from classic to modern. We also hold an exhibition of an up and coming local artist each and every month. Thanks to the budding young talent in our local area these events are always popular. No ticket required just arrive on the day.
The building that houses the gallery opened its doors to the public in 1996 for the Northamptonshire Fine Art Exhibition inspired by the Great Exhibition in London of 1851. In 1996 it became the Angelo Art Gallery.
The Angelo Art Gallery holds the largest collection of work by local talent, showing many of these paintings and sketches alongside loans from other larger galleries.
